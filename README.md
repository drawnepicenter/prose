### Prose

This repo is for playing around with [Leximaven](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/leximaven) and demonstrating its features, as well as paying homage to some writers that inspire me.

#### Bird

It is said that [The Bird is the Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfin%27_Bird). Is that really true? [Let's find out...](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/prose/blob/master/bird.md)

#### Inspiration

- [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce) for his stream-of-consciousness style and language hacking, especially in [Finnegans Wake](http://www.finnegansweb.com/wiki/index.php/TOC)
- [Maynard James Keenan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_James_Keenan#Writing_and_performance_style) and his lyrics for [Tool](http://songmeanings.com/artist/view/songs/249/), [A Perfect Circle](http://songmeanings.com/artist/view/songs/131/), and [Puscifer](http://songmeanings.com/artist/view/songs/137438962150/)
