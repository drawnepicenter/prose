### Prose

This repo is for playing around with [Leximaven](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/leximaven) and demonstrating its features, as well as paying homage to some writers that inspire me. Accepting pull requests, the crazier the better!

#### Bird

It is said that [The Bird is the Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfin%27_Bird). Is that really true? [Let's find out...](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/prose/blob/master/bird.md)

#### Skewl

I hated school. Did you ever have a teacher like [this?](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/prose/blob/master/skewl.md)

#### WWW

So shall media be [understood](https://github.com/drawnepicenter/prose/blob/master/WWW.md). Thus spake [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan). Manuscript culture. The medium is the message.

#### Inspiration

- [The Chaos](http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html) by Gerard Nolst Trenit√©
