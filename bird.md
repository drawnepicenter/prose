April 20th, 1620 hours.

It was suck a budiful day I decided to take a walk iff the plarnk.

A flvagrant sat on a bench feeding pidgins and creoles.

Even though he looked a bit seedy, I tapped my hit to him and said,

"High how are you?"

He shrugged and said, "So-sober."

I looked down at his feathery friends.

"Ah, to bee a bird, I mean, to see a seed."

He squinted at me and said, "A seed easy?"

I replied, "No, 'eh bee seedy."

A young couple was approaching us. My companion owlgled the lady and said,

"See that chick with the feather in her cap? She let me touch her titmouse."

The young man turned cardinal red and said, "I should pfinch your face in!"

The homeless man flipped him the bird and shouted, "You're too scared to try it, you yellow-bellied sapsucker!"

As they hurried away, the young man muttered, "He's raven mad."

I dodon't know what to say. The indignent just sat there puffin on his halfpipe.

"What are you stoking there friend?"

"Crackpot."

"You can slow-cock a rooster hen one of those, just chickadee timer often."

"Yeah, but my brownies always come out hash-baked."

"Well, maybe you just need some potluck. Here's a five-leaf clover, a tokin' of my appreciation."

"What kind bud?"

"This strainge? Blueberrdy."

He took the nice nugget from me and said, "Dank." He rolled a joint and bluntly said,

"I'll spliff this with you, fifty-fifty."

After hemping and hawking for a bit, I said, "Sure, what the flock."

I sat on the bench and shared the marywanna sugarette with him.

After awhile he asked me, "How high are you?"

I just said, "Birds I view."
